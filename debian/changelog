log4shib (2.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * [338086a] Use the 'replace' merge mode.

  * [9e39ece] Drop our patches (everything went upstream)

    Made possible by dropping log4shib-config (the old-style config script).

log4shib (1.0.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Use upstream fix for converting the thread ID to a string.
  * Move doxygen and graphviz to Build-Depends-Indep now that the buildds
    have proper arch-specific build support.  The upstream build system
    should automatically decline to build the documentation if those
    packages aren't installed.

log4shib (1.0.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian based on the Debian packaging done by Scott
    Cantor and included with the upstream source.  (Closes: #666263)
  * New upstream release.
    - Fix error handling when Appenders fail.
    - Fix crash when file appender can't open file.
    - Fix varargs issue on x86_64.
  * Patch upstream configure.in to declare m4 as the macro directory so
    that autoreconf works properly.
  * Write a manual page for log4shib-config in POD and generate it and
    install it as part of the package build.
  * Don't install the section 3 man pages generated by Doxygen.  Many of
    them are malformatted, and they're not horribly useful.  The same
    information is available in the HTML documentation.
  * Add Maintainer, Uploaders, and Vcs-* headers for the pkg-shibboleth
    packaging team.
  * Work around issues with -lpthread and libtool and with picking up
    dpkg-buildflags options in pkgconfig using code copied from
    opensaml2.
  * Suggest liblog4shib-doc from liblog4shib-dev.
  * Remove any copy of jQuery installed by Doxygen and use the version
    packaged for Debian.
  * Regenerate the build system with dh_autoreconf during build.
  * Enable --as-needed to avoid unnecessary build dependencies.
  * Update package long descriptions from the ITP.
  * Change package section to devel from contrib/devel.
  * Lower the priority to extra.
  * Convert the shared library package to multiarch.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Update debhelper compatibility level to V9.
    - Add ${misc:Depends} to all dependencies.
    - Use dpkg-buildflags for compiler and linker flags.
    - Enable hardening flags.
  * Switch to Debian source package format 3.0 (quilt).
  * Update standards version to 3.9.3.
  * Rewrite debian/copyright in the copyright-format 1.0 format and
    include more licensing and copyright information.
